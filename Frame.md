#Frame

One of the most important parts of a printer to get right when building is the frame. It holds absolutely everything on a printer, so it is crucial to build it square and correctly.

I used blue loctite for the entire frame, it is stored in a red bottle, because... stupidity.

There are a few things in consideration with the K3 frame. It is **not a complete box.** Instead it is rectangular in shape, streching relatively tall, and the bottom four extrusions are lifted by the width of a 2020 extrusion, or 20mm.
