# Chilli-K3-Build-log

I am not a great build log writer, but I will try my best to explain each step I took while building this k3, trials and tribulations included. If the step I have done wasn't the best way or even the wrong way, I will still show it but with two ** near it. 

This log is built around the already excellent guide of Johnnykwwang, without him this build guide will have been even more difficult to write.

This build guide will be split into a few main sections and into different .md files. I will leave out the sourcing since the K3 will be differently sourced depending on where you live. I live in China and I also frequent the US due to academia, as such I picked up a K3 kit from Fabreeko and will piece together other parts from different places on 'Chinese Amazon': Taobao. As such this build may be different price wise.
